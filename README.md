# ABOUT: Digital Bookshelf
Digital Bookshelf is an application for people who love to read. As an avid reader, I am always searching for new books, whether that be at the library, on Amazon or GoodReads. I have found that I have muliple lists of the books I've read in multiple places. Digital Bookshelf allows a user to create a master list of all the books they've read by adding a review to each book. Can't remember what a book was about or how much you liked said book when you look at your other lists? Digital Bookshelf allows you to add comments about the book and rate it. You can see all the books they've read by viewing your bookshelf.
