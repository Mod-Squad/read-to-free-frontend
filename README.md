# Read to Free: A Digital bookshelf

Read to Free is an application for people who love to read. As an avid reader, I
am always searching for new books, whether that be at the library, on Amazon or GoodReads. I have found that I have muliple lists of the books I've read in multiple places. Read to Free allows a user to create list of all the books they've read by adding a review to each book. Can't remember what a book how much you liked a book when you look at your other lists? Read to Free allows the user to add comments about the book and rate the book. Users can see all the books they've read by viewing their bookshelf.
