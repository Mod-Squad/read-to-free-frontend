## ABOUT: Digital Bookshelf
Digital Bookshelf is an application for people who love to read. As an avid reader, I am always searching for new books, whether that be at the library, on Amazon or GoodReads. I have found that I have muliple lists of the books I've read in multiple places. Digital Bookshelf allows a user to create a master list of all the books they've read by adding a review to each book. Can't remember what a book was about or how much you liked said book when you look at your other lists? Digital Bookshelf allows you to add comments about the book and rate it. You can see all the books they've read by viewing your bookshelf.

## WORKFLOW
When I initially started coding the different features of my application, I was following my user stories. But, I quickly realized that each step in completing that user story was composed of many smaller steps which I hadn't planned out. For future projects, I would create a card for each step of a user story, instead of just creating one user story card. I also found that I really enjoyed following the same steps to 'test' small aspects of my features and getting confirmation that the small sections of code that I had written were functioning as I expected. 

## FUTURE FEATURES
  * Use a 3rd party API (GoodReads or Open Library) to add book covers and short descriptions of the books.
  * Add a background image and a theme.
  * Add a way for users to be able to import book lists from other sites.
